(these start the subroutine that makes blocks move)

(on top layer in block or next to block, can fly through pipes)

(player can try leaving each, sprite needs to adjust)

(always move with block)

(these items get removed with the block over holes)

(need one for the manual to be possible to view)
gp_show_manual = init_theme:6 or init_theme:7

(all of these are regenerated every turn and not supposed to be used on the left side of game logic rules)
