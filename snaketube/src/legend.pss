(these start the subroutine that triggers an again turn and the one that responds)
gp_again = again_col or again_exit or again_fly:dirs or again_gravity or again_entry or again_wait_entry
(these start the subroutine that makes blocks move)
gp_move_sources = player_move:dirs

(on top layer in block or next to block, can fly through pipes)
gp_items = player

(player can try leaving each, sprite needs to adjust)
gp_exits = room_entry or room_exit

(always move with block)
gp_block = block or con:x:dirs or again_fly:dirs or pusher or gp_items

(these items get removed with the block over holes)
gp_can_fall = block or con:x:dirs or pusher

(need one for the manual to be possible to view)
gp_allow_manual = init_theme_4 or init_theme_5 or init_theme_6

(all of these are regenerated every turn and not supposed to be used on the left side of game logic rules)
